                      "value": "You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer Spell List.\n\nTools Required. You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, or another kind of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).\n\nCantrips. You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.\n\nLvl --> Cantrips --> Prepared Spells --> 1st --> 2nd --> 3rd --> 4th --> 5th\n1st  --> 2 --> 2 --> 2 --> / --> / --> / --> /\n2nd  --> 2 --> 3 --> 2 --> / --> / --> / --> /\n3rd  --> 2 --> 4 --> 3 --> / --> / --> / --> /\n4th  --> 2 --> 5 --> 3 --> / --> / --> / --> /\n5th  --> 2 --> 6 --> 4 --> 2 --> / --> / --> /\n6th  --> 2 --> 6 --> 4 --> 2 --> / --> / --> /\n7th  --> 2 --> 7 --> 4 --> 3 --> / --> / --> /\n8th  --> 2 --> 7 --> 4 --> 3 --> / --> / --> /\n9th  --> 2 --> 9 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> / --> /\n10th --> 3 --> 9 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> / --> /\n11th --> 3 --> 10 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> / --> /\n12th --> 3 --> 10 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> / --> /\n13th --> 3 --> 11 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 1 --> /\n14th --> 4 --> 11 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 1 --> /\n15th --> 4 --> 12 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 2 --> /\n16th --> 4 --> 12 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 2 --> /\n17th --> 4 --> 14 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 3 --> 1\n18th --> 4 --> 14 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 3 --> 1\n19th --> 4 --> 15 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 3 --> 2\n20th --> 4 --> 15 --> 4 --> 3 --> 3 --> 3 --> 2"

Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.\n\nYou learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.\n\nCreating an Item. When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker's Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.\n\nIf a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.\n\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.\n\nYou can't have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.\n\nDuration. A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn't permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.\n\nIf an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.\n\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan's Tools.\n\nLvl --> Plans Known --> Magic Items\n2nd  --> 4 --> 2\n3rd  --> 4 --> 2\n4th  --> 4 --> 2\n5th  --> 4 --> 2\n6th  --> 5 --> 3\n7th  --> 5 --> 3\n8th  --> 5 --> 3\n9th  --> 5 --> 3\n10th --> 6 --> 4\n11th --> 6 --> 4\n12th --> 6 --> 4\n13th --> 6 --> 4\n14th --> 7 --> 5\n15th --> 7 --> 5\n16th --> 7 --> 5\n17th --> 7 --> 5\n18th --> 8 --> 6\n19th --> 8 --> 6\n20th --> 8 --> 6"

As a Bonus Action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of itself.\n\nCreating Additional Elixirs. As a Magic action while holding Alchemist's Supplies, you can expend one spell slot to create another elixir. When you do so, you choose its effect from the Experimental Elixir table rather than rolling.\n\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels, you can make an additional elixir at the end of each Long Rest: a total of three at level 5, four at level 9, and five at level 15.\n\nExperimental Elixir Table:\n1. Healing. The drinker regains a number of Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your Intelligence modifier. The number of Hit Points restored increases by 1d8 when you reach Artificer levels 9 (3d8) and 15 (4d8).\n2. Swiftness. The drinker's Speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour. This bonus increases when you reach Artificer levels 9 (15 feet) and 15 (20 feet).\n3. Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes. The duration increases when you reach Artificer levels 9 (1 hour) and 15 (8 hours).\n4. Boldness. The drinker can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw it makes for the next minute. The duration increases when you reach Artificer levels 9 (10 minutes) and 15 (1 hour).\n5. Flight. The drinker gains a Fly Speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes. The Fly Speed increases when you reach Artificer levels 9 (20 feet) and 15 (30 feet).\n6. You determine the elixir's effect by choosing one of the other rows in this table."

You design your armor to become a towering juggernaut in battle. It has the following features:\n\nForce Demolisher. An arcane wrecking ball or sledgehammer projects from your armor. The demolisher counts as a Simple Melee weapon with the Reach property, and it deals 1d10 Force damage on a hit. If you hit a creature that is at least one size smaller than you with the demolisher, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself or pull the creature up to 10 feet toward yourself.\n\nGiant Stature. As a Bonus Action, you transform and enlarge your armor for 1 minute. For the duration, your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn't enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn't change. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nGuardian. You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:\n\nThunder Pulse. You can discharge concussive blasts with strikes from your armor. The pulse counts as a Simple Melee weapon and deals 1d8 Thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the pulse has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.\n\nDefensive Field. While Bloodied, you can take a Bonus Action to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Artificer level. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you doff the armor.\n\nInfiltrator. You customize your armor for subtler undertakings. It has the following features:\n\nLightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on your armor, from which you can shoot bolts of lightning. The launcher counts as a Simple Ranged weapon with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 Lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with the launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target.\n\nPowered Steps. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.\n\nDampening Field. You have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other, as normal."

On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly toward you to an unoccupied space.

The damage die of your Lightning Launcher increases to 2d6 Lightning damage. Any creature that takes Lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn.
